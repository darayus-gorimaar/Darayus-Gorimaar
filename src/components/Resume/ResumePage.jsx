        <p>
          Created and documented comprehensive unit tests, providing a roadmap
          for ongoing development. Designed and implemented new Arbitrary
          Waveform Generator architecture in C++ and documentation (for
          technical audiences). This resulted in a 90% reduction in glitches
          when modifying waveform configurations. Logged stories, tasks, and
          bugs in Jira as part of agile practices, facilitating effective issue
          prioritization to manage multiple tasks simultaneously within the
          Agile development framework. Integrated three key features into
          oscilloscopes using Git version control software, including Bandwidth
          Filtering, Arbitrary Waveform Generation, and Demo and Training
          Signals. Collaborated with hardware, chip design, and marketing teams
          on a daily basis to foster a cross-functional approach to product
          development. Resolved five critical and serious customer defects,
          playing a key role in timely delivery of a release build, which was
          essential to the projectâ€™s market success.

          Ideated an innovative clog mitigation technique to significantly
          improve user experience of the PAX Era vaporizer, completely resolving
          a critical failure in 25% of pods and ensuring project delivery stayed
          on schedule. Validated new pod and vaporizer builds reliability
          through electrical engineering test suites. Analyzed data and
          presented recommendations to project managers for informed
          decision-making. Investigated points of failure in pre-production
          vaporizers using root cause analysis. Performed visual inspection,
          signal integrity analysis, power consumption analysis, and thermal
          imaging to identify sources of performance issues. Coordinated efforts
          with firmware team to troubleshoot and resolve cross-functional
          integration challenges.

        <h1>Heater Coil Characterization Test Rig </h1>
        <p>
          Created a new rig to test 8 heater coils at once, increasing the
          number of devices under test possible by 700%. Drafted technical
          specifications and procedural guides for test rig, ensuring clarity
          and accessibility for engineering teams. Utilized Arduino, Python,
          RS-232 communication, and a custom board designed with Altium Designer
          to capture and log data, contributing to product improvement and
          reliability.
